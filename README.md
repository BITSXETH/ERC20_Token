# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic ERC20 Token creation using Hardhat. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/deploy.js --network localohost
```
